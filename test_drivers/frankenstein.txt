Excerpt from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

Volume I, Chapter 1

I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and it was not until the decline of life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons who might carry his virtues and his name down to posterity.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.

Having no other means of support, he became a beggar. His former friends, his noble and wealthy acquaintance, were now become his enemies; and he was reduced to being a servant of the poor. He was a man of great ability, and had a great deal of experience in the world. He was a man of great ability, and had a great deal of experience in the world.
