## About
This project is one out of the two projects that are to be a part of the Operating Systems formal evaluation.

The goal of this project is to create our own SHELL program through the use of system calls and core C programming concepts. This shell aims to mimic the behaviour of Bash, the standard Unix shell.



This is a test. Please help us. Jarod has locked us in his basement with Kevin.

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding﻿
